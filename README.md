# AgentRatio (GitHub Pages)

This repository hosts the AgentRatio public site.

## Getting started
1. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. Set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**, then choose `main` and `/ (root)`.
3. Wait ~1–2 minutes for the build to complete.
4. Visit `https://<username>.github.io/agentratio/`.

## Custom domain (optional)
Add a `CNAME` in **Settings → Pages** with `AgentRatio.com` and configure DNS when ready.

## Editing
- Modify `index.md` for the Home page.
- Replace `assets/img/logo.png` with your final logo (same filename) if needed.
- Add more pages later (e.g., `bva-executives/`).
